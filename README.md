# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

## Project Name
From Portland to Portland

## Description of the Project and its Functionality
Responsive web site that demonstrates use of relative heights and widths, media queries, and other tools to render a Figma design brief.

## Description of the technologies and techniques used
* Figma: Collaborative interface design tool. See the link below to review the design brief specific to this project.
* Fonts: Fonts stored locally in the project structure rather than imported from Google Fonts or other external sources. I commented out the variable font and experimental multi-axis font to pass Practicum's code review.
* `normalize.css` and `.editorconfig` to standardize CSS starting point and IDE, respectively.
* Block-Element-Modifier (BEM) Methodology to organize HTML code and CSS classes.
* Image compression via tinypng. See the link below for more information about this application.
* Media queries: CSS tool to render blocks, elements, or modifiers differently depending on screen size or device.
* Approach: I started with the largest screen resolution (1280px), and I worked my way down to the smallest screen resolution (320px).
* Flexbox and Grid: responsive tools for organizing content on a web page.
* Font smoothing.

## Code review outcome
I entered the GitHub pages link on the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). The validator identified tno errors and two warnings:
* **Warning:** Section lacks heading. Consider using `h2`-`h6` elements to add identifying headings to all sections. `From line 42, column 7; to line 42, column 15`
* **Warning:** Section lacks heading. Consider using `h2`-`h6` elements to add identifying headings to all sections. `From line 59, column 7; to line 59, column 30`

## Checklist
* I reviewed my work against [Practicum's Checklist](https://code.s3.yandex.net/web-developer/checklists/checklist-3-en/index.html) for this project.

### Overview
* Intro
* Figma
* Images

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

** [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/AtbNbstbxWPcMqvF061V0R/Sprint-3%3A-From-Portland-to-Portland-%7C-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
